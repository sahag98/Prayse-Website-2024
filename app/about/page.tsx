      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-3">How Prayse Started</h1>
      <p>Hey there, my name is Sahag and I&apos;m the founder of Prayse.</p>
      <div className="md:w-2/3 mt-5 space-y-3">
        <p>
          During the summer of 2022, I was attending a bible study at my church,
          New Life Church. The study reached a point where the teacher began
          taking prayer requests. As everyone shared their requests, we
          struggled to find pens and papers to write them down, so some resorted
          to using their phones.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I started typing everyone&apos;s requests into my phone, I heard a
          simple voice in my head say,{" "}
          <span className="italic">
            &quot;What if you build an app for this purpose?&quot;
          </span>{" "}
          At this point in my life, I was pursuing a Bachelor&apos;s degree in
          Computer Science. I prayed about that voice and soon began to develop
          the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple of weeks later, the first version of Prayse (Prayer & Praise)
          was published on both the Google Play Store and the App Store. I
          shared it with my friends and they found it useful. To my surprise,
          even people from the internet started downloading and using it.
          Honestly, I was shocked, because for me, Prayse was just meant to be a
          personal app to manage my prayer requests. As I continued praying
          about Prayse, the need to keep developing it grew and I became 100%
          certain that this was something the Lord wanted me to do. Hadn&apos;t
          fully thought about the long-term journey of Prayse or its ultimate
          goal, but through the Lord&apos;s guidance, was at least able to
          figure out the very next step.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward two years later: Prayse has reached thousands of people,
          and what God has done and is continuing to do is honestly amazing. I
          can&apos;t find the words to describe how Prayse has been a blessing
          to others and also to me. Beyond the numbers and statistics, the thing
          that sticks with me the most is the little comments I receive about
          Prayse. If you&apos;ve interacted with me regarding Prayse or left a
          comment on our online platforms, know that you&apos;ve made a
          significant impact. The current and future accomplishments of Prayse
          are not only fruit unto my account, but also yours.

          Following God&apos;s direction isn&apos;t always easy, but it is
          simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;re someone who spends alot of time thinking about your
          future, your career, or anything else, I encourage you to pause and
          reflect on this simple question: What does God want me to do next?
          Pray, read God&apos;s word, seek counsel, and by faith, take that very
          next step. No matter how big or small that step might be, FULLY
          surrender it to the Lord and marvel at the amazing things He will do
          to guide and provide for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, and before anything else, if you do not have a
          personal relationship with Jesus, may I advise you to accept Him as
          your Lord and Saviour. Close your eyes, and say this: Dear Lord,
          I&apos;m here. Please forgive me from my sins, and help me to abide in
          You, as You abide in me. From this point on, my life is Yours. Help me
          to live a life that glorifies You, and reflects Your love and grace to
          others. In Jesus&apos; name, Amen.
